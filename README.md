# Backend Recipe Planner

This is the backend for the recipe planner project. This is a personal web dev project designed to help users save and organize their personal recipes and other recipes they have found online. The weekly planner helps users plan the recipes that they want to cook for the week and also help them create a shopping list based on the recipes for the week.
